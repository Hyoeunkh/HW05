In the communication fields, betweenness centrality is used to find the shortest path node 
that can behave as a bridge between two other nodes. In our case, we have also used to it see 
the most active node which can be considered bridge between different types of personality. 
Though, ENTP and ENTJ were found higher in degree frequency, but these personality types 
could not manage to come in-between for the best communication. Whereas, INTP 
personality type appeared highest in betweenness centrality among all sixteen personality 
types with 36 frequency. On the other hand, ENTP personality type did not obtain the high 
degree frequency but it appeared 26 times in betweenness centrality. Moreover, INFP, ISFP, 
and INFP were remained almost disappeared within team choice for maintaining the 
betweenness. It is, may be, because the feeling (F) and introvert (I) traits are sentimental and 
get hurt quickly. It might have dragged these personality types to not follow them in the teams 
as members. Additionally, it should be noted here that programmer has job to communicate 
frequently with team members. Therefore, finding betweenness centrality among team 
programmers can bring the lead programming skills visible which can help to let members 
communicate or work with each other
